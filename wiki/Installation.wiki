=== Vimball ===

Vim is now bundled with a plugin management utility called "Vimball", and it can be used to install Conque. First, download a `.vba` version of conque to any location on your hard drive. Then perform the following commands:

{{{
vim conque_term_XXX.vba
:so %
:q
}}}

The `:ConqueTerm` command will now be available the next time you start Vim. You can delete the `.vba` file after you have verified Conque was installed successfully.

=== Zip Archive ===

Alternatively, you can download a `.zip` or `.tar.gz` archive of Conque. Copy the files into the following locations:

{{{
 $HOME/.vim/autoload/conque_term.vim
 $HOME/.vim/doc/conque_term.txt
 $HOME/.vim/plugin/conque_term.vim
 $HOME/.vim/syntax/conque_term.vim
}}}
